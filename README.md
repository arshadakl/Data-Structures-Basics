# Data Structures in JavaScript

Welcome to my GitHub repository that focuses on basic data structure operations implemented in JavaScript. This repository is a collection of commonly used data structures, starting with linked lists, and will expand to cover more as I continue to add new problems and solutions.

## Linked List

### Introduction

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next one in the sequence. This repository provides a simple implementation of a linked list in JavaScript.

### Operations

The following basic operations are covered:

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Searching
- Traversal
- Length determination

### How to Use

To use the linked list implementation in your JavaScript project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-js.git
