# Data Structures in JavaScript

Hello! I'm Arshad, a web developer, and welcome to my GitHub repository that focuses on basic data structure operations implemented in JavaScript. This repository is a collection of commonly used data structures, starting with linked lists, and will expand to cover more as I continue to add new problems and solutions.

### Operations
